    nvlNar "Charred sand dotted the landscape, while heavy black clouds with countless bolts of lightning running throughout, striking the land and causing any remnant of the previous world to go up in flames." 
    nvlNar "Darkness surrounded him, but he was used to this. {w}For thousands of years, even before the first man crawled from the mud, this was his existence."
    nvlNar "Time was a construct he found no comfort in counting, for he didn’t experience things as mortals do. {w}Instead, in a cyclical manner, he could see everything before his very eyes, past, present, and future."
    nvl clear
    nvlNar "Having unraveled the mysteries of the material world, the Architects would never be able to track him down. {w}They gave him the power."
    nvlNar "He could manipulate matter and its confines, bending reality to his whim." 
    nvlNar "In spite of such great power, he felt incredibly saddened, for this was without limits. {w}His life was extended to fulfill a forgotten promise, but he no longer cared."

    nvlNar "His destiny was decided eons ago, set in stone by the Architect who once was his friend."
    nvlNar "Yet he ignored his own destiny, disrespected the elders, and broke the seal. {w}He released The Flame onto every animal." 
    nvlNar "He wanted things to change because he already knew what would happen if he kept The Flame only to himself and the Architects, the gift to look up and tell to the stars who burnt without cease. "
    nvlNar "Without guidance, he went astray, trudging though another thousand years without a purpose to fulfill or work to occupy his emptyness. {w}He witnessed civilizations rise and fall."
    nvl clear
    nvlNar "Agriculture had been discovered by the mortals a few years prior to his arrival. {w}Finally, something new! The landscape sprang to life as they worked the soil, yet he felt almost nothing towards these little creatures."
    nvlNar "He witnessed their resilience: They fought with all their might to survive pestilence, disasters, murder, and war."
    nvlNar "Death was the barrier that separated the mortals of this world from what came after." 
    nvl clear
    nvlNar "He once tried to dispel their suffering, but it only ended in chaos. {w}He was called a god, a demon, a monster, an angel, the Fire, and the Darkness."
    nvlNar "None of those titles ever felt right. He never cared for his name. {w}Existence itself was painful, even though he was unchanging and immortal." 
    nvlNar "He saw the oceans dry, the mountains blown by wind, turning into sand, and mountains to take form yet again."
    nvlNar "Yet he was moved by the determination of the many sentient beings below in the mud."
    nvl clear 
    nvlNar "They played and constructed buildings, to which they gave many purposes: houses for unknown figures, houses for goods, houses for sleep, amongst many other kinds."
    nvlNar "He finally began to see potential in them, though it soon gave way to disappointment for practicing so many vile things."
    nvlNar "Slavery, unjust punishment, murder, infidelity and corruption."
    nvl clear
    nvlNar "He could do nothing about it; direct interference would only reveal himself and make him easy prey for the Architects."
    nvlNar "He despised being granted such immense, albeit useless power."
    nvlNar "In ages past, his mentor taught him the process of creating, administrating, archiving, and destroying all, from a grain of sand to entire galaxies."
    nvl clear
    nvlNar "It was always the same process: create until there’s nothing left to make, oversee, legislate the order of the divine, record the failures and shortcomings of the mortals, then destroy all until nothing remains."
    nvlNar "The current world was born from the first Crack in the Shell; a second could bring instability and lead to ruin."
    nvlNar "That’s why he was assigned this exceptional job, keep the second crack sealed. {w}Twice he had broken his sacred duty, breaking his vow. If it weren’t for other pressing matters, he would be much present in the lives of Earthlings."
    nvl clear
    nvlNar "Despite everything, he chose to remain dormant."
    nvlNar "His disobedience delayed the cycle of awakening of the Sons of Light, and they rotted beneath the ground. {w}Their souls dispersed, and a new form of life emerged." 
    nvlNar "Though they possessed the souls of Sons, their forms assumed a beast-like appearance, and each had their own quirks."
    nvl clear
    nvlNar "These were now his sons, not the Architects’. This was his own creation. {w}He changed the cycle for once. Now the eyes of the Architects would be upon him, but for once he didn’t care, and neither did his helpers."
    
    nvlNar "There were mere changes here and there; he was proud for once, but also disappointed."
    nvlNar "It all fell into the same script as before: violence, war, and treachery. He needed to interfere again."
    nvlNar "The eyes of the Architects were only a temporary measure. Eliminating them, separating the fabric of this reality and isolating it from their influence shouldn’t be too hard ..."
    nvlNar "..."
    nvlNar "The entire process as effortless. {w}He should be fine now; the Architects were forever locked out of here. Now, the real fun could begin."
    nvl clear
    nvlNar "Morals and ethics were not etched into his mind; he didn’t need those; they were mere concepts for mortals beyond his understanding. Maybe once his ethereal essence finally disintegrates, he could finally experience ever-elusive death."
    nvlNar "Now as an Architect as well, would experiencing death be a good thing? He questioned it no more. {w}He needed to take additional steps to put his plan into action."
    nvlNar "However, he couldn’t find anybody fit for the task at hand: to hold infinite power, to be able to rip apart galaxies, to know all the secrets of existence."
    nvlNar "Of course, he had already secured the future holder of this power. {w}It was imperative they wouldn’t break out of the confines of this plane and pierce through his barrier." 
    nvlNar "Perhaps they could see into realms beyond this existence through a {i}{color=#e619b9}reflection{/color}{/i}. But there was no time to speculate."

    nvlNar "By this time his sons' settlement was quietly growing into a massive city, perhaps the biggest Anthro settlement at this point in any cycle's history. {w}Yet he also witnessed once more the thing he truly despised, despite being mostly amoral." 
    nvlNar "Enslaved people were seen right and left. All of them were hoofed. {w}They enslaved deer, goats, and even donkeys."
    nvl clear
    nvlNar "He was disgusted by this, to force a man to do forced work, even if it meant to pay off debt. {w}He was forced into his position, an all-powerful yet unwilling Watcher, and did not wish the same for his children."

    nvlNar "There he finally noticed someone, around early childhood, serving in the household of a wealthy family." 
    nvlNar "He still had no name and could barely speak. {w}After all, why bother with a name for mere property?"
    nvlNar "The child cowered within the walls of the house, afraid of the massive world that stood out to him. {w}His owners, a family of cats, were away for awhile. {w}He spoke directly into the kid's skull to communicate more privately."
    nvl clear
  
# “Him”:
    him "“Hey kiddo, I think I'd like to help you.”"
# Kiddo:
    kiddo "“Ah, who are you? Get out of my head!”"
# “Him”:
    him "“Oh, sorry, don’t be afraid! I just wanna talk to ya.”"
    him "“If you would rather speak face to face, just look for a more secluded space.”"
    nvlNar "The kid almost cried from the sudden introduction of a new voice inside his brain." 
    nvl clear
    nvlNar "He had considered calling his parents, but he knew they would just ignore him like always. {w}After all, they had their duties to attend to."
    nvlNar "When the child moved to a more secluded space of the house, “He” was already there expecting the kid."
    nvlNar "Somehow, the child recognized his appearance even though they had never met." 
    nvlNar "This would have seemed strange if he appeared as the Anthros, but “his” muzzle was flattened, almost box-like. {w}More importantly, his body had the appearance of a night sky, with stars fading in and out."
# Kiddo:
    nvl clear
    kiddo "“Are you one of the Dingir?”"
# “Him”:
    him "“{cps=2}...{/cps}”"
    him "“My apologies, little one, but I don’t hold the to the concept you mortals usually have of labeling yourselves from the moment of birth.”"
    him "“I once had a name, but now I go by none.”" 
    him "“Simply call me “He”, and we’ll be on the same page.”"
# Kiddo:
    kiddo "“You’re very strange, sir; I shouldn’t be here…”"
    nvl clear
    kiddo "“Mommy is going to be mad at me.”"
# “Him”:
    him "“Worry not. The purpose of this visit is to give you my power. We shall make a deal.”"
    him "“I see a great brilliance in your future, little one, and with that, you shall observe over the creation and give this power good use.”"
# Kiddo:
    kiddo "“What you talking about? You're weird!”"
# “Him”:
    nvl clear
    him "“Just know one thing, my time is not long at the moment. Don’t worry about the details, just follow your intuition and hold my hand.”"
    nvlNar "Though intimidated by the strange figure before him, the child felt a calmness wash over his body, and it settled deep within." 
    nvlNar "He didn’t see \"him\" as a threat or a friend, but perhaps it would be his means to get Pa and Ma out of debt and finally be free."
    nvlNar "He would give anything to get away from that family of nasty cats, especially their horrible, entitled brat son who kept pulling on his growing antlers."
    nvlNar "He hated that little cat brat so much!"
    nvl clear
# Kiddo:
    kiddo "“Deal.”"
    nvlNar "As the child put his hands forward, so did “him”. “His” hand had a kind of different warmth to it, smooth but also ethereal... {w}kind of like touching the night sky." 
    nvlNar "He also felt a stinging sensation in his hands like something was piercing through his skin, but it was bearable enough that he continued holding “his” hand."
    nvlNar "A small tingle started in “his” chest and went up to “his” shoulder and then onto “his” arm, down the elbow, meeting the child’s hand to be absorbed by the jovial boy."
    nvlNar "Once the ritual was done, “he” spoke up."
# “Him”:
    nvl clear
    him "“Doesn't it feel amazing? I still remember how that moment felt.”"
    him "“I fully trust you, kiddo, bear this power for me, wield it wisely for all of us.”"
    him "“I know I may seem to be a completely unhinged person right now, but I’m actually{cps=1}...-{/cps}”"
    nvlNar "The figure started to dissipate ever so slightly, each star beginning to fade, being blown away from his body, evaporating into dust. {w}“He” collapsed on the floor, still trying to stand up."
# Kiddo:
    kiddo "“Hey sir are you ok? I can get a healer for you quick.”"
# “Him”:
    him "“There’s no need for that, young one; I made this decision knowing the consequences.”"
    nvl clear
    him "“I’m going to be fine. {w}I’m not made of bone and flesh like you; my existence is a mere detail in the great scheme of things. {w}I have denied my existence in favor of changing things and breaking this accursed cycle." 
    him "Unlike me, you shall not be bound by the decree of the Architects to watch and not interfere.”"
    him "“It is time I finally experience what you mortals call, dying.”"
    him "“Promise me, use this gift to change things, otherwise my efforts had gone to fail. {w}I won't force you, but please be my acolyte, and as a master, I shall fully release you onto the wilderness.”"
    nvl clear
# Kiddo:
    kiddo "“What! {w}No, you cannot go; I know nothing what you have given me.”" 
    kiddo "“What am I even supposed to do?”"
    nvlNar "Whimpering, the kid tried to quieten his senses and be reasonable, but he became increasingly susceptible to crying." 
    nvlNar "While he was well acquainted with pain, death was not something he was used to witnessing. {w}Tears soaked his fur, but even so, “he” had faded into the air."
    nvlNar "Yet as the last shreds of \"his\" existence dissipated, the boy's emotions suddenly became controlled, as if they could be easily dealt with. {w}He had never been able to do that, but it was such an incredible feeling." 
    nvl clear
    nvlNar "He nearly forgot what had just happened a moment ago."
    nvlNar "No longer worried, he reverted to his regular childhood self and ignored all that had happened."
    nvlNar "A week or two later, a tingling sensation spilling from his fingers made him realize that moment wasn't a dream. {w}It wasn’t a trick of his mind. {w}It was quite real." 
    nvlNar "Had “he” been a god among men, he didn’t know..."
    nvlNar "But what he did is that he had a mission. {w}He just didn’t know where to begin."
