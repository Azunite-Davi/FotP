    "Between tears and attempts to speak, Nabisin finally could muster some words amongst sobs."

    n    "“It was not wise of me to sneak you in.”"
    n    "“I’m so, so, so sorry Lulu. It shouldn’t have ended this way, and now they might come for us both.”"
    "Lulu knew exactly what he was speaking of; it was not the third or fourth time this has happened."

    l    "“Do you trust me?”"
    # Nabisin:
    n    "“Of course I do my beloved Luludân.”"
    n    "“It would be fool of me not to.”"
    # Lulu:
    l    "“Then it is time to finish this day.”"
    l    "“It has been long enough.”"

    l    "“You are mine and I am yours, and we are both the secret of each other’s existence.”"
    l    "“Never forget this.”"
    "All his worries faded and they both went to sleep. Maybe it was the chilly night that made everything else so much bearable. As Nabisin went to sleep he locked his eyes on Lulu as he also began drifting to dreamland."
    "Good night my lover, I hope I neve lose you out of my sight."
